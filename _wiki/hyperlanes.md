Hyperlanes are one of the more reliable forms of faster-than-light travel. It 
uses hyperspace, which in itself is not particularly safe or efficient. 
However, it is versatile. Hyperlanes are formed from beacons or station along 
the lane that stabilize and protect it. This allows hyperspace travel along 
the lanes to be faster and more efficient, and safe from the typical dangers 
of hyperspace.

However, this also has the effect of severe limitations on the versatility of 
hyperspace.
