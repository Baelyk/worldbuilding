There are many ways to travel faster than light, the most common of which are
the use of [hyperlanes](hyperlanes), a warp drive, or a jump drive. All of the
methods have benefits and drawbacks, as expected. Hyperlanes are typically the
most common form of FTL travel, because of the ease of access for all ships, not
just large, expensive vessels.

Hyperlanes are naturally occuring pathways that allow ships to travel faster
than light by exciting the space around them. Vessels traveling faster than
light in hyperlanes never leave real space, so the coordination of ships using
hyperlanes is critical to safety, especially in important lanes. Warp drives
allow ships to warp the space around to carry the ship, rather than propel the
ship itself, i.e. a warp drive does not propel the ship, but change space so
that the ship moves relative to space. This can create dangerous wakes, but it
is extremely effective in combat, due to the high control of destination and
ease of maneuver in warp. A jump drive allows a ship to instantaneously travel
to a different location, at the cost of increasing fuel costs as the distance
increases. Jump drives function by bringing the ship into and out of an adjacent
dimension in which time does not function in the same manner. This allows the
ship to travel at conventional speeds while arriving instantaneously.
